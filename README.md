# updatedPortfolio
Sunday's Assignment

In this assignment I will have redesigned and restructured a presentable portfolio that utilizes javascript/ html/ css aspects made with an attempt using Materialize instead of Bootstrap. Links to my first project and most accomplished/ refined homework assignments will be showcased as well.

There are links included that are pathways to my social media presence including Linkdin, Instagram and Email respectively.

UPDATE:
The site is all contained on one page with all links active. HOWEVER the links in the navbar at the top will direct the user to additional pages just as a safety precaution if I was too overzealous with the design. There is much to be improved as far as quality but it should satisfy the requirements.

(I created the gif thats in the header, btw)
