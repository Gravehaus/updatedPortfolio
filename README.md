Sunday's Assignment

In this assignment I will have redesigned and restructured a presentable portfolio that utilizes javascript/ html/ css aspects made with an attempt using Materialize instead of Bootstrap. Links to my first project and most accomplished/ refined homework assignments will be showcased as well.

There are links included that are pathways to my social media presence including Linkdin, Instagram and Email respectively.
